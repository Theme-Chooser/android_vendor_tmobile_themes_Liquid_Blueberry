What's in this version:
LauncherPro OPTIONAL theming!
To theme the LPP widgets, you have two options:
1)Download the LPP theme with the Blue Bionic name. These are static themes (don’t change color automatically) and your non-rooted friends can use them too.
2)Download the Chameleon theme that Upwardspiral made. When you are not using one of my themes, it looks like Liquid Blueberry. However, this automatically will change colors whenever you change between any of Upwardspiral themes :)
